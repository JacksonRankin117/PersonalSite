        <p>
            I've always loved building things from scratch. Coding allows me to turn abstract ideas into real, functional tools 
            and applications. On this page, I'll feature several of the programming projects I've completed. These may include 
            class assignments, personal experiments, or apps I built just for fun. Each project will include a short description, 
            the technologies used (like Python, JavaScript, or C#), and what I learned while building it. I'll also include 
            screenshots and maybe even links to GitHub repositories or hosted demos. Visitors might be fellow students, professors, 
            or even potential employers. They'll be looking for code quality, creativity, and the ability to explain my thought 
            process. This section is here to show not just what I built, but how I built it and why I made certain decisions. 
            Questions this page will answer: What programming languages do I know? What kinds of apps or tools can I create? How 
            do I approach solving problems with code? I want this page to reflect my growth and curiosity as a developer. Even 
            small or unfinished projects can demonstrate creativity and persistence. I'll organize the projects in a way that's 
            easy to browse, with visuals and clear summaries.

                <h3> Ray Tracing Engine - C#</h3>
                <p> This was an incredible experience for me. I was always interested in graphics, so for a final project in an 
                    OOP course I made a ray tracing engine from a book called "Ray Tracing in One Weekend". It was challenging 
                    but rewarding to see the images come to life.</p>

                <h3>Julia Set - Python</h3>
                <p> This was a compounding project for me. I first made a program to make a Mandelbrot set, and then I made one 
                    to create a Julia Set. In the future I hope to make a program that animates many Julia sets together. </p>

                <h3> Double Slit</h3>
                <p> This program helped me to explore my interest of optics. I first have to define an aperture, and then I can 
                    simulate the diffraction pattern that results from it.</p>
