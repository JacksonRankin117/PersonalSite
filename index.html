                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> This website is a personal space where I showcase my interests, skills, and creative work. I'm passionate 
                    about both programming and photography, and this site brings those worlds together. Visitors to my site 
                    will get to know a bit about me, what I enjoy creating, and how I approach technical and artistic work. 
                    I created this website as a portfolio hub. Whether someone is looking to explore my coding projects or 
                    browse through my photography portfolio, this site will guide them to the right place. My hope is that 
                    visitors will find value in what I createâ€”maybe a recruiter will take interest in a project, or another 
                    photographer will connect with my visual style. This home page serves as an introduction. I'll briefly 
                    describe what I do, link out to my work, and provide updates or new content when I finish a new project or 
                    upload a new photo set. It'll be clean, minimal, and easy to navigate. Visitors might come here wondering: 
                    Who am I? What projects have I built? What kind of photography do I do? This page is meant to answer those 
                    questions quickly and lead them to explore more. </p>

                <h3> Old Trailer </h3>
                <p>This photo was a spur of the moment thing. I was walking with my sister in her neighborhood, and I saw this 
                    old trailer out of the corner of my eye. I quickly got my Mamiya RB67 with a 50mm lens out and snapped the 
                    photo at 1/250" at f/22</p>

                <h3> Totality </h3>
                <p>This photo was taken during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024 in Bloomfield, IN, using a Sony a37 with 
                    an SVBONY 540mm f/7 scope. It was shot without a filter during totality.</p>

                <h3> Uke </h3>
                <p>This photo was taken in my family's home. I requested my dad to play the ukelele a little, and I set up the 
                    shot. This is one of the most meaningful photographs I have ever taken. Definitely one of my favorites.</p>

                <h3> Ray Tracing Engine - C#</h3>
                <p> This was an incredible experience for me. I was always interested in graphics, so for a final project in an 
                    OOP course I made a ray tracing engine from a book called "Ray Tracing in One Weekend". It was challenging 
                    but rewarding to see the images come to life.</p>

                <h3>Julia Set - Python</h3>
                <p> This was a compounding project for me. I first made a program to make a Mandelbrot set, and then I made one 
                    to create a Julia Set. In the future I hope to make a program that animates many Julia sets together. </p>

                <h3> Double Slit</h3>
                <p> This program helped me to explore my interest of optics. I first have to define an aperture, and then I can 
                    simulate the diffraction pattern that results from it.</p>

            <h2> Motivation</h2>
            <p> My main source of motivation for my art and my programming is my curiosity. I want to capture raw moments in time, 
                and explore the beauty of the world around me. I also want to learn more about the technical aspects of 
                photography and programming, and how I can use them to express my creativity. For programming, I am particularly 
                interested in the intersection of art and technology, and how I can use code to create visually stunning and 
                thought-provoking experiences.</p>
