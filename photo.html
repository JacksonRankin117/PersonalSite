                <h2> About My Photography</h2>
                <p> Photography is my artistic medium of choice. I believe that a mind that is open to both seeing the world artistically and scientifically can create truly unique work. My approach combines technical skill with creative vision, allowing me to capture moments in a way that resonates with me.</p>

                <h3>Photo Title 1</h3>
                <p>This photo was a spur of the moment thing. I was walking with my sister in her neighborhood, and I saw this old trailer out of the corner of my eye. I quickly got my Mamiya RB67 with a 50mm lens out and snapped the photo at 1/250" at f/22</p>

                <p>This photo was taken during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024 in Bloomfield, IN, using a Sony a37 with an SVBONY 540mm f/7 scope. It was shot without a filter during totality.</p>

                <h3> Uke </h3>
                <p>This photo was taken in my family's home. I requested my dad to play the ukelele a little, and I set up the shot. This is one of the most meaningful photographs I have ever taken. Definitely one of my favorites.</p>
